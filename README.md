The success of restaurants in the modern world

The research question: Is it possible to predict the success of a restaurant based on the successes of previous restaurants, average price per dish, delivery cost, minimum delivery price, etc.

We reached a prediction percentage of 74 percent, both in the training data and in the test data, we came to the conclusion that the success of a restaurant depends on factors other than those we collected: the name of the restaurant, rating, number of raters, maximum delivery time, minimum delivery price and minimum delivery, and even on factors that are not given to quantify
We were surprised by the fact that there is a connection between a minimum order and the success of a restaurant - the higher the minimum order, the higher the chance of success.
